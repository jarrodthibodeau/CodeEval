CodeEval
========

Here are my CodeEval challenges submissions that I have been working on recently. Majority of them are coded in Java but
I have started to tackle some of the challenges in C#.

Some of these challenges are imcomplete and will be updated once I can figure out the problems are. Please feel free to 
look through my code and give me some comments!
