## Challenge: You are given a string 'S' and a character 't'. Print out the position of the rightmost 
## occurrence of 't' (case matters) in 'S' or -1 if there is none. The position to be printed out is zero based.

import sys

test_cases = open(sys.argv[1], 'r')

for test in test_cases:
	stripper = test.strip('\n')
	line = stripper.split(',')
	print line[0].rfind(line[1])
